Add a variable to jan. 1 if it is jan, 0 if it is not.
Do the same for every month
Make precipitation 0 and 1 values, use logistic model in stan code


```{r}
# Make precipitation 0 and 1 values
weather$codedPrecipitation <- ifelse(weather$Precipitation > 0, 1, 0)
```

```{r}
#Add a variable to jan. 1 if it is jan, 0 if it is not.
weather$month <- sapply(weather$Date.time,substr, 6,7)


weather <- dummy_cols(weather,select_columns = c("month"))


```

```{r}
# change col names
names(weather)[9:20] <- c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","June","July","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec")
